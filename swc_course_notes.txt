To check status: 

> git status

Start tracking: git add names.txt

Rolling back tracking/staging:

> git reset HEAD names.txt -> that removes the file from the staging area
> git checkout -- names.txt -> retrieve the last file in the stage, overwriting my file.

To check status:

> git log -2

Last three steps..

> git diff names.txt 

this gives the differences between staged and committed files.
